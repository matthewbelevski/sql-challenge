# sql-challenge

For this challenge, the goal was to create a table schema's for a database in PostgreSQL using exisitng csv files as a template.

Once designed, and the csv files imported, the next step was to perform analysis on the data using queries to filter through the data and perform aggregates when necessary. 

Finally as a bonus, the task was to import the SQL Database into Pandas in order to convert the tables into DataFrames and then plot them.
